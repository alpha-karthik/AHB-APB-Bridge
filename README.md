# AHB-APB Bridge Development and Verification

Welcome to the repository for the project on the Development of an AHB-APB Bridge using RTL design and Functional Verification with System Verilog.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design, development, and verification of an AHB (Advanced High-Performance Bus) to APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) bridge. The bridge serves as a critical component in SoC (System-on-Chip) designs, facilitating communication between high-performance and peripheral devices.

The project involves two main aspects:
1. RTL Design: Developing the AHB-APB Bridge using Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding in Verilog. This includes defining the architecture, interfaces, and control logic of the bridge.
2. Functional Verification: Employing System Verilog and verification methodologies to rigorously test the functionality and compliance of the AHB-APB Bridge. Techniques such as Constraint Random Coverage-Driven Verification and Assertion-Based Verification will be utilized.

## Repository Contents

The repository is structured as follows:

- `source_files/`: Contains the Verilog source code for the AHB-APB Bridge RTL design.
- `testbench_files/`: Includes the System Verilog testbench files for functional verification.
- `documents/`: Documentation related to the project, including design specifications and verification plans.
- `sim_results/`: Results of simulation runs, waveforms, and coverage reports.
- `LICENSE`: The license governing the use of this project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alpha-karthik/AHB-APB-Bridge.git/`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd AHB-APB-Bridge`
3. Explore the `source_files/` directory for the RTL design and the `testbench_files/` directory for the verification environment.
4. Follow the documentation in the `documents/` directory for detailed information about the design and verification methodology.
